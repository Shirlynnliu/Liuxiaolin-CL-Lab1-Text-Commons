Title: Urban legend
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_legend
Content: Urban legend (sometimes modern legend, urban myth, or simply legend) is a genre of folklore concerning stories about an unusual (usually scary) or humorous event that many people believe to be true but largely are not.
These legends can be entertaining but often concern mysterious and troubling events, such as disappearances and strange objects or entities. Urban legends may confirm moral standards, reflect prejudices, or be a way to make sense of societal anxieties. 
In the past, urban legends were most often circulated orally, at gatherings and around the campfire for instance. Now, they can be spread by any media, including newspapers, mobile news apps, e-mail, and most often, social media.  Some urban legends have passed through the years/decades with only minor changes, in where the time period takes place. Generic urban legends are often altered to suit regional variations, but the lesson or moral generally remains the same.

Title: 9/11 conspiracy theories
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories
Content: There are various conspiracy theories that attribute the preparation and execution of the September 11 attacks against the United States to parties other than, or in addition to, al-Qaeda. These include the theory that high-level government officials had advance knowledge of the attacks. Government investigations and independent reviews have rejected these theories. Proponents of these theories assert that there are inconsistencies in the commonly accepted version, or that there exists evidence that was ignored, concealed, or overlooked.
The most prominent conspiracy theory is that the collapse of the Twin Towers and 7 World Trade Center were the result of controlled demolitions rather than structural failure due to impact and fire. Another prominent belief is that the Pentagon was hit by a missile launched by elements from inside the U.S. government, or that hijacked planes were remotely controlled, or that a commercial airliner was allowed to do so via an effective stand-down of the American military. Possible motives claimed by conspiracy theorists for such actions include justifying the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 (even though the U.S. government concluded Iraq was not involved in the attacks) to advance their geostrategic interests, such as plans to construct a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan. Other conspiracy theories revolve around authorities having advance knowledge of the attacks and deliberately ignoring or assisting the attackers.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the technology magazine Popular Mechanics have investigated and rejected the claims made by 9/11 conspiracy theorists. The 9/11 Commission and most of the civil engineering community accept that the impacts of jet aircraft at high speeds in combination with subsequent fires, not controlled demolition, led to the collapse of the Twin Towers, but some conspiracy theory groups, including Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, disagree with the arguments made by NIST and Popular Mechanics.

Title: 2012 phenomenon
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon
Content: The 2012 phenomenon was a range of eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic or transformative events would occur on or around 21 December 2012. This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, and festivities took place on 21 December 2012 to commemorate the event in the countries that were part of the Maya civilization (Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador), with main events at Chichén Itzá in Mexico and Tikal in Guatemala.
Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed for this date. A New Age interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era. Others suggested that the date marked the end of the world or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next solar maximum; an interaction between Earth and Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy; the Nibiru cataclysm, in which Earth would collide with a mythical planet called Nibiru; or even the heating of Earth's core.
Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of cataclysmic events as they arose. Mayan scholars stated that no classic Mayan accounts forecast impending doom, and the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented Mayan history and culture. Astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as pseudoscience, having been refuted by elementary astronomical observations.

Title: 2016 clown sightings
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_clown_sightings
Content: In 2016, there were reports of people disguised as evil clowns in incongruous settings, such as near forests, schools and neighbourhoods. The incidents were reported in the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and subsequently in other countries and territories starting during August 2016. The sightings were first reported in Green Bay, Wisconsin, in what turned out to be a marketing stunt for a horror film. The phenomenon later spread to many other cities in the U.S. By mid-October 2016, clown sightings and attacks had been reported in nearly all U.S. states, 9 out of 13 provinces and territories of Canada, and 18 other countries.
Prior to the spate of incidents in 2016, numerous sightings of people dressed as clowns in odd or incongruous settings have occurred throughout the world since 2013. The proliferation of videos and images of these precursor sightings spread through social media posts and viral sharing of the content.

Title: Alligator bait
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator_bait
Content: Depicting African-American children or infants as alligator bait was a common trope in American popular culture in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Images of African-American children or infants being hunted by or used to lure alligators ("gators") was widespread in North American white popular culture during the 19th and 20th centuries. The motif was present in diverse forms of media, including newspaper reports, songs, sheet music, and visual art, often appearing in conjunction with other racist tropes. While the use of Black children as bait in alligator hunting is repeatedly mentioned in primary sources, these are often vague and their reliability is disputed. In American slang, alligator bait is a racial slur for African-Americans.

Title: Andretti curse
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andretti_curse
Content: The Andretti Curse, sometimes referred to as Andretti Luck, is a sports-related curse in a string of bad luck the Andretti racing family has experienced in their efforts to win the Indianapolis 500 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
Patriarch Mario Andretti won the Indianapolis 500 in 1969. In victory lane, prolific car owner Andy Granatelli planted a kiss on the young Andretti's cheek. Following the win, despite a Hall of Fame career in Indy cars, Formula One, stock cars, and sports cars, Andretti never managed to win the race again before his retirement in 1994.  The misfortune has extended to his sons Michael and Jeff, nephew John, and grandson Marco, totaling 80 starts. The reasons for defeat have included a bevy of mechanical failures, crashes, and a last-lap pass in 2006.
According to Robin Miller, the curse started in 1970 when Mario Andretti, Andy Granatelli, and Clint Brawner were involved in feud over the team. Partners Granatelli and Brawner split, and Andretti sided with Granatelli. Brawner's wife Kay supposedly cast a hex upon them, promising never would an Andretti ever again win the Indianapolis 500.
Success has not completely eluded the Andretti family. Michael Andretti won the Indianapolis 500 five times as a car owner of Andretti Autosport. The racing team, formerly known as Team Green also won the race in 1995, prior to Andretti's involvement. Mario, Michael, Jeff, and Marco were all winners of the Indy 500 Rookie of the Year award. Marco, meanwhile, is the only family member besides Mario to win a race of any kind at the Speedway, the  Liberty Challenge for the Infiniti Pro Series on the combined road course at the Speedway in 2005.

Title: Artificial structures visible from space
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_structures_visible_from_space
Content: Artificial structures visible from space without magnification include highways, dams, and cities. 
Whether an object is visible depends significantly on the height above sea level from where it is observed. The Kármán line, at 100 kilometres (62 mi), is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space. However, astronauts typically orbit the Earth at several hundreds of kilometres; the ISS, for example, orbits at about 420 km (260 mi) above the Earth, and the Moon orbits at about 380,000 km (240,000 mi) away.

Title: Aurora (aircraft)
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(aircraft)
Content: Aurora is a rumored mid-1980s American reconnaissance aircraft. There is no substantial evidence that it was ever built or flown and it has been termed a myth.
The U.S. government has consistently denied such an aircraft was ever built. Aviation and space reference site Aerospaceweb.org concluded, "The evidence supporting the Aurora is circumstantial or pure conjecture, there is little reason to contradict the government's position."
Former Skunk Works director Ben Rich confirmed that "Aurora" was simply a myth in Skunk Works (1994), a book detailing his days as the director. Rich wrote that a colonel working in the Pentagon arbitrarily assigned the name "Aurora" to the funding for the B-2 bomber design competition and somehow the name was leaked to the media.
In 2006, veteran black project watcher and aviation writer Bill Sweetman said, "Does Aurora exist? Years of pursuit have led me to believe that, yes, Aurora is most likely in active development, spurred on by recent advances that have allowed technology to catch up with the ambition that launched the program a generation ago."

Title: Mythology of Benjamin Banneker
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology_of_Benjamin_Banneker
Content: According to accounts that began to appear during the 1960s or earlier, a substantial mythology has exaggerated the accomplishments of Benjamin Banneker (1731–1806), an African-American naturalist, mathematician, astronomer and almanac author who also worked as a surveyor and farmer.
Well-known speakers, writers, artists and others have created, repeated and embellished a large number of questionable reports during the two centuries that have elapsed since Banneker lived. Several urban legends describe Banneker's alleged activities in the Washington, D.C., area around the time that he assisted Andrew Ellicott in the federal district boundary survey. Others involve his clock, his astronomical works, his almanacs and his journals. Although part of African-American culture, many of these accounts lack support by historical evidence. Some are contradicted by evidence.
A United States postage stamp and the names of a number of recreational and cultural facilities, schools, streets, and other facilities and institutions throughout the United States have commemorated Banneker's documented and mythical accomplishments since the two centuries he lived.

Title: Barometer question
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer_question
Content: The barometer question is an example of an incorrectly designed examination question demonstrating functional fixedness that causes a moral dilemma for the examiner. In its classic form, popularized by American test designer professor Alexander Calandra in the 1960s, the question asked the student to "show how it is possible to determine the height of a tall building with the aid of a barometer." The examiner was confident that there was one, and only one, correct answer, which is found by measuring the difference in pressure at the top and bottom of the building and solving for height. Contrary to the examiner's expectations, the student responded with a series of completely different answers. These answers were also correct, yet none of them proved the student's competence in the specific academic field being tested.
The barometer question achieved the status of an urban legend; according to an internet meme, the question was asked at the University of Copenhagen and the student was Niels Bohr. The Kaplan, Inc. ACT preparation textbook describes it as an "MIT legend", and an early form is found in a 1958 American humor book. However, Calandra presented the incident as a real-life, first-person experience that occurred during the Sputnik crisis. Calandra's essay, "Angels on a Pin", was published in 1959 in Pride, a magazine of the American College Public Relations Association. It was reprinted in Current Science in 1964, in Saturday Review in 1968 and included in the 1969 edition of Calandra's The Teaching of Elementary Science and Mathematics. Calandra's essay became a subject of academic discussion. It was frequently reprinted since 1970, making its way into books on subjects ranging from teaching, writing skills, workplace counseling and investment in real estate to chemical industry, computer programming and integrated circuit design.

Content: James Bartley (1870–1909) is the central figure in a late nineteenth-century story according to which he was swallowed whole by a sperm whale. He was found still living days later in the stomach of the whale, which was dead from harpooning.
The story first appeared in anonymous form in American newspapers.  The anonymous article appeared in the St. Louis Globe Democrat of Saint Louis, Missouri, then the note appeared in other newspapers with the title "A Modern Jonah" or something similar in multiple newspapers.
The story was later reprinted in international newspapers, such as the Yarmouth Mercury in England, Great Yarmouth, on August 22, 1891, under headlines like ‘Man in a Whale’s Stomach’ and ‘Rescue of a Modern Jonah’.

Content: The Baskerville effect, or the Hound of the Baskervilles effect, is the alleged self-fulfilling prophecy that there is an increase in rate of mortality through heart attacks on days considered unlucky because of the psychological stress this causes on superstitious people.  The term derives from the Sherlock Holmes novel The Hound of the Baskervilles in which a hellish-looking dog chases Sir Charles Baskerville, sufferer of a chronic heart disease. According to legend, the dog cursed his family, Baskerville runs in great fear and dies of a heart attack "with an expression of horror in his face".

--- Entry 24 ---
Title: Beale ciphers
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beale_ciphers
Content: The Beale ciphers are a set of three ciphertexts, one of which allegedly states the location of a buried treasure of gold, silver and jewels estimated to be worth over $60 million as of January 2025. Comprising three ciphertexts, the first (unsolved) text describes the location, the second (solved) ciphertext accounts the content of the treasure, and the third (unsolved) lists the names of the treasure's owners and their next of kin.
The story of the three ciphertexts originates from an 1885 pamphlet called The Beale Papers, detailing treasure being buried by a man named Thomas J. Beale in a secret location in Bedford County, Virginia, in about 1820. Beale entrusted a box containing the encrypted messages to a local innkeeper named Robert Morriss and then disappeared, never to be seen again. According to the story, the innkeeper opened the box 23 years later, and then decades after that gave the three encrypted ciphertexts to a friend before he died. The friend then spent the next 20 years of his life trying to decode the messages, and was able to solve only one of them, which gave details of the treasure buried and the general location of the treasure. The unnamed friend then published all three ciphertexts in a pamphlet which was advertised for sale in the 1880s.
Since the publication of the pamphlet, a number of attempts have been made to decode the two remaining ciphertexts and to locate the treasure, but all efforts have resulted in failure.
There are many arguments that the entire story is a hoax, including the 1980 article "A Dissenting Opinion" by cryptographer Jim Gillogly, and a 1982 scholarly analysis of The Beale Papers and their related story by Joe Nickell, using historical records that cast doubt on the existence of Thomas J. Beale. Nickell also presented linguistic evidence demonstrating anachronisms—words such as "stampeding", for instance, are of later vintage. His analysis of the writing style showed that Beale was almost certainly James B. Ward, whose 1885 pamphlet brought the Beale ciphers to light. Nickell argues that the tale is thus a work of fiction; specifically, a "secret vault" allegory of the Freemasons; James B. Ward was a Mason himself.

Title: Black Volga
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Volga
Content: Black Volga (Polish: czarna wołga) refers to an urban legend widespread in Poland, Romania, Hungary, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Greece and Mongolia, mainly in the 1960s and 1970s. The legend refers to a black (or in some versions red) GAZ-21 or GAZ-24 that was allegedly used to abduct and murder people. According to different versions, it was driven by communist secret police, Russian mafia, Satanists or Satan himself. The car is described as having white wheel rims, white curtains or other white elements.

This impression was also caused by the active use of the passenger car of the Gorky Automobile Plant GAZ-M1 (Emka) by the NKVD bodies during the years of mass repression. For the sake of saving money, during almost all the time of its release, the M1 was only available with black paint, which emphasized the ominous image of the car.
Supposedly, victims were kidnapped and then murdered by the perpetrators to use their blood as a cure for rich Westerners or Arabs suffering from leukemia. Other variants used organ theft as the motive, combining it with another infamous legend of kidney theft by the KGB. The legend surfaced again in the late 20th century, with a BMW or Mercedes car taking the Volga's place. The Black Volga was sometimes depicted with horns instead of wing mirrors. It could also have the number "666" on the license plate, as well as having white windows or curtains. In this version, the driver (allegedly the devil) would ask passers-by for the time and kill them when they approached the car to answer. In another version of the legend, the victim would die at the same time a day later (the driver would say: "Tomorrow you will die at this hour"). However, there was an effective defence method—when the potential victim answered "It is God's time", the car would quickly vanish. 
In Czechoslovakia, the story appeared in the late 1970s as the black ambulance, while in Romania, the Volgas were replaced in the 1970s with Dacia 1301s, a modified version of the Dacia 1300 with several features not available to the public, which were eventually replaced by ambulances as well in the 1990s.

Title: Blue Whale Challenge
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Whale_Challenge
Content: Blue Whale Challenge (Russian: Си́ний ки́т, romanized: Siniy kit), also known simply as the Blue Whale, is a social network phenomenon, first appeared in Russia in 2013, that is claimed to exist in several countries. It is a "game" reportedly consisting of a series of tasks assigned to players by administrators over a 50-day period, initially innocuous before introducing elements of self-harm and the final challenge requiring the player to commit suicide.
"Blue Whale Challenge" first attracted news coverage in May 2016 in an article in the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta that linked many unrelated child suicides to membership of group "F57" on the Russian-based VK social network. A wave of moral panic swept Russia. The piece was criticised for attempting to make a causal link where none existed, and none of the suicides were found to be a result of the group's activities. Claims of suicides connected to the game have been reported worldwide, but none have been confirmed.
The game has reportedly been banned in some countries, including Egypt, Kenya, and Pakistan. Experts have said that it is difficult or even impossible to ban the game.

Title: Boiling frog
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog
Content: The boiling frog is an apologue describing a frog being slowly boiled alive. The premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of sinister threats that arise gradually rather than suddenly.
While some 19th-century experiments suggested that the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, especially Fratscher's experiments in 1875, according to some modern biologists the premise is false, arguing that changing location is a natural thermoregulation strategy for frogs and other ectotherms, and is necessary for survival in the wild, so that a frog that is gradually heated will jump out. Furthermore, a frog placed into already boiling water will die immediately, not jump out. These modern biologists, however, did not produce any evidence contradicting Fratscher's results since they did not test such slow water-heating as in Fratscher's experiments.

Title: Bonsai Kitten
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai_Kitten
Content: BonsaiKitten.com was a hoax shock site that claimed to raise kittens in jars, so as to mold the bones of the kitten into the shape of the jar as the cat grows, similarly to a bonsai plant. It was launched in 2000 by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate student under the alias of Dr. Michael Wong Chang. Many people believed that the black comedy website was serious, and filed complaints to animal rights organizations and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI and several other organizations, including Snopes.com and the Humane Society of the United States, debunked the concept of a "bonsai kitten".
The website's legacy remains as a notable example of a hoax site, and generated much discussion about Internet animal cruelty and the issue of free speech.

Title: Brown note
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_note
Content: The brown note (sometimes brown tone or frequency) is a hypothetical infrasonic frequency capable of causing fecal incontinence by creating acoustic resonance in the human bowel. Considered an urban myth, the name is a metonym for the common color of human faeces. Attempts to demonstrate the existence of a "brown note" using sound waves transmitted through the air have failed.
Frequencies supposedly involved are between 5 and 9 Hz, which are below the lower frequency limit of human hearing. High-power sound waves below 20 Hz are felt in the body.

Title: Jan Harold Brunvand
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Harold_Brunvand
Content: Jan Harold Brunvand (born March 23, 1933) is an American retired folklorist, researcher, writer, public speaker, and professor emeritus of English at the University of Utah.
Brunvand is best known for popularizing the concept of the urban legend, a form of modern folklore or story telling. Urban legends are "too good to be true" stories that travel by word of mouth, by print, or by the internet and are attributed to an FOAF: friend of a friend. "Urban legends," Brunvand says, "have a persistent hold on the imagination because they have an element of suspense or humor, they are plausible and they have a moral."
Though criticized for the "popular" rather than "academic" orientation of his books, The Vanishing Hitchhiker and others, Brunvand felt that it was a "natural and worthwhile part of his job as a folklorist to communicate the results of his research to the public."
For his lifetime dedication to the field of folklore, which included radio and television appearances, a syndicated newspaper column, and over 100 publications (articles, books, notes and reviews), Brunvand is considered to be "the legend scholar with the greatest influence on twentieth-century media."

Content: A burglar sign is a marking supposedly left on or near a property by a burglar or their accomplice, signalling in code that the building is vulnerable or unoccupied.
The practice is considered to be an urban legend, with Snopes commenting that publicly creating such signs would be an unnecessary additional risk for the burglar, when they could instead simply note down details of addresses. Those wishing to communicate property information to an accomplice could do so more easily by other channels, without making the same information available to other criminals.

Title: Can you hear me? (alleged telephone scam)
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_you_hear_me%3F_(alleged_telephone_scam)
Content: "Can you hear me?" is a question asked in an alleged telephone scam, sometimes classified as an internet hoax. There is no record of anyone having ever been defrauded in such a scam, according to the Better Business Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Federation of America. Reports of the supposed scam began circulating in the United States and Canada in 2017.
It is alternatively known as the say "yes" scam. Reports on this hoax and its circulation on social media sites have continued into the 2020s in the United States. Government entities, such as police departments or state financial agencies, have sometimes unknowingly contributed to the credibility of the hoax by reporting it to the public as it if was factual.
Security experts have explained that the calls were likely an automated dialer employed by a telemarketing firm to confirm the authenticity of the telephone numbers on its dialing lists, not an attempt at financial fraud.

Title: Candle Cove
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_Cove
Content: Candle Cove is an online creepypasta horror story written by web cartoonist and author Kris Straub. The story centers on a discussion of the titular fictional children's television series on an Internet forum. Straub has stated that he was inspired to write the creepypasta after reading an article in The Onion entitled "Area 36-Year-Old Still Has Occasional Lidsville Nightmare".
Straub's story quickly became popular, inspiring numerous YouTube videos and fan fictions. In 2015, Straub self-published Candle Cove in a collection of short stories entitled Candle Cove and Other Stories. The Verge commented that Candle Cove differed from other creepypastas in that while most creepypasta have an "anonymous folkloric quality", Candle Cove originated from a known source and author.

Content: During and after the reign of the Empress Catherine II of Russia, whose long rule led to the modernisation of the Russian Empire, many urban legends arose, some based on true events, concerning her sexual behaviour.
Catherine had about 22 male lovers throughout her life, some of whom would reap political benefits from their relationship with her, and many of whom were relatively younger. In addition to her sexual relationships, her multiple relationships with Russian nobles, allegations of her being a nymphomaniac or a libertine, rumours that she liked to collect erotic furniture, and an atmosphere of palace intrigue cultivated by her son Paul I of Russia, led to unflattering portrayals of Catherine.
Some called her the "Messalina of the Neva", while others termed her a nymphomaniac. There is also a legend that she died while having sex with a horse.

Content: Chako Paul City (or Shakebao) is a fictional town of 25,000 exclusively female residents located in northern Sweden, reports of which surfaced in Chinese press agencies Xinhua and Harbin News in 2009. It was founded in 1820 by a wealthy, man-hating widow. Men are banned from entering the town and most of its desperate, sex-starved inhabitants have turned to lesbianism. Immediately following the reports, millions of Chinese men swamped Swedish tourist companies with requests for information about it.
Claes Bertilson, spokesperson for Sweden's Association of Local Authorities and Regions, said: “At 25,000 residents, the town would be one of the largest in northern Sweden, and I find it hard to believe that you could keep something like that a secret for more than 150 years.”

Content: The Charlie Charlie challenge is a divination game in which the putative answer to a yes–no question is found by waiting for a balanced pencil to point towards the word "Yes" or "No" written on a sheet of paper. As with a Magic 8 Ball, most players, typically teenagers, do not sincerely believe in the power of the mechanism. The game is a modern incarnation of an older Spanish game called Juego de la Lapicera ("the Pencil Game"). It was popularized in the English-speaking world in 2015, partly through the hashtag #CharlieCharlieChallenge. On 29 April 2015, an alarmist tabloid television newscast about the game being played in Hato Mayor Province of the Dominican Republic was uploaded to YouTube, and the unintentional humor in the report led to the game trending on Twitter, crossing the language barrier to be played around the world.

Title: Chimera House
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_House
Content: The Chimera House (also known  "13 Floor Money Back House", 13 Story Money Back Haunted House or the 13th Floor Haunted House) is an urban legend which typically involves a group of teenagers going out for a night on the town, only to stumble across a large, worn down multiple story building where they are offered to go through a haunted attraction that consists of "real" horrors inside. In the story, the teens are asked to pay a certain amount of money (anywhere from 20 to 100 dollars) and told they will receive a portion back for every floor they complete. The twist is that no one has ever completed the house, and the ones who tried never came back out. Rumors differ about the various horrors inside the house, from poisonous animals to deformed humans or other supernatural phenomenons.  Accounts vary as to the exact number of floors in the house, but most accounts give the house 13 floors.

Content: The Choking Doberman is an urban legend that originated in the United States. The story involves a protective pet found by its owner gagging on human fingers lodged in its throat. As the story unfolds, the dog's owner discovers an intruder whose hand is bleeding from the dog bite.
Jan Harold Brunvand, a folklorist and professor emeritus of English at the University of Utah, wrote about this and other urban legends in his book The Choking Doberman and Other "New" Urban Legends published in 1984 by W.W. Norton & Company. He provided the reader with several varying accounts of the story. While the basic elements of the story remain the same in each version, the details, such as the number of fingers found, the breed of dog, and the condition of the intruder when discovered change slightly.

Title: Cleveland sports curse
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_sports_curse
Content: The Cleveland sports curse was a sports superstition involving the city of Cleveland, Ohio, and its major league professional sports teams, centered on the failure to win a championship in any major league sport for 52 years, from 1964 to 2016. Three major league teams based in Cleveland contributed to belief in the curse: the Browns of the National Football League (NFL); the Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA); and the then-Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB).
The championship drought began after the Browns defeated the Baltimore Colts in the 1964 NFL Championship Game, two seasons before the first Super Bowl. The city's professional sports teams, including the short-lived Barons franchise of the National Hockey League, then went an unprecedented 147 combined seasons without a championship. The drought ended when the Cavaliers beat the Golden State Warriors in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals by overcoming a 3–1 series deficit, an event widely interpreted as having broken the curse.

Title: COVID-19 party
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pox_party
Content: Pox parties, also known as flu parties, are social activities in which children are deliberately exposed to  infectious diseases such as chickenpox. Such parties originated to "get it over with" before vaccines were available for a particular illness or because childhood infection might be less severe than infection during adulthood, according to proponents. For example, measles is more dangerous to adults than to children over five years old. Deliberately exposing people to diseases has since been discouraged by public health officials in favor of vaccination, which has caused a decline in the practice of pox parties, although flu parties saw a resurgence in the early 2010s.
Another, more modern, method of intentional contagion involves shipping infectious material. In many parts of the world, shipping infectious items is illegal or tightly regulated.

Title: Cow level
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_level
Content: The secret cow level, or simply the cow level, is a level featured in the action role-playing hack and slash video game series Diablo, developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. It first appears as postgame content in 2000's Diablo II, where it is officially known as the "Moo Moo Farm". Players may access the level after collecting a special combination of items to conjure a portal leading to the level. The player character is confronted upon arrival by a large horde of armed anthropomorphic cows led by a boss character called the "Cow King".
The cow level originated as a hoax about a secret level perpetrated by players of 1997's Diablo, and has been described as one of the most famous and well-known urban legends related to video gaming by publications. The attention surrounding the hoax influenced developers to acknowledge it as an inside joke by seeding Easter egg references in related games during the late 1990s: the Diablo expansion pack Diablo: Hellfire, and 1998's StarCraft. The level's appearance in Diablo II marked the first instance of the hoax being developed into actual in-game content. Fan appeal for the cow level affected later Blizzard titles, which led to similarly themed levels appearing in Diablo III and World of Warcraft, as well as several imitations and recreations in other video games.

Title: Cow tipping
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_tipping
Content: Cow tipping is the purported activity of sneaking up on any unsuspecting or sleeping upright cow and pushing it over for entertainment. The practice of cow tipping is generally considered an urban legend and stories of such feats are viewed as tall tales. The implication that rural citizens seek such entertainment due to lack of alternatives is viewed as a stereotype.  The concept of cow tipping apparently developed in the 1970s, though tales of animals that cannot rise if they fall has historical antecedents dating to the Roman Empire.
Cows routinely lie down and can easily regain their footing unless sick or injured. Scientific studies have been conducted to determine if cow tipping is theoretically possible, with varying conclusions.  All agree that cows are large animals that are difficult to surprise and will generally resist attempts to be tipped. Estimates suggest a force of between 3,000 and 4,000 newtons (670 and 900 pounds-force) is needed, and that at least four and possibly as many as fourteen people would be required to achieve this. In real-life situations where cattle have to be laid on the ground, or "cast", such as for branding, hoof care or veterinary treatment, either rope restraints are required or specialized mechanical equipment is used that confines the cow and then tips it over.  On rare occasions, cattle can lie down or fall down in proximity to a ditch or hill that restricts their normal ability to rise without help. Cow tipping has many references in popular culture and is also used as a figure of speech.

It was one of two stations built to serve the new site of the Great Exhibition building, the Crystal Palace, when it was moved from Hyde Park to Sydenham Hill after 1851.  It was the terminus of the Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway (CPSLJR), which was later absorbed by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR). The station closed permanently in 1954. The Grade II listed subway, that led to the exhibition halls, was restored in 2024 using £2.8m of grant funding; on completion, the station was expected to be removed from the Heritage at Risk Register.

Content: The Curse of Billy Penn (1987–2008) was a sports-related curse, urban legend, and popular explanation for the failure of major Philadelphia professional sports teams to win championships following the March 1987 construction of the One Liberty Place skyscraper, which exceeded the height of William Penn's statue atop Philadelphia City Hall. For decades prior to the construction of One Liberty Place, there had been a gentlemen's agreement in place to ensure that no building in Philadelphia would be permitted to be higher than the William Penn statue atop Philadelphia City Hall.
The curse ended on October 29, 2008, when the Philadelphia Phillies won the 2008 World Series, a year and four months after a statuette of the William Penn figure atop City Hall was affixed to the final beam during the June 2007 topping-off of the Comcast Center, which made it the highest building structure in the city at the time.

The curse began when upset Giants fans in the New York metropolitan area placed a hex on the relocated franchise. The curse proved true in the World Series of 1962, 1989, and 2002. It ended when the Giants won the 2010 World Series in their fourth World Series appearance since the move to San Francisco.

Title: Curse of Rocky Colavito
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Rocky_Colavito
Content: The Curse of Rocky Colavito is a phenomenon that supposedly prevents the Cleveland Guardians of Major League Baseball (MLB) from winning, be it the World Series, the American League (AL) pennant, reaching postseason play, or even getting into a pennant race.  Its origin is traced back to the unpopular trade of right fielder Rocky Colavito to the Detroit Tigers for Harvey Kuenn in 1960. It was not claimed that Colavito placed the curse, and he has denied doing so. It is one of several curses believed to have stricken the city of Cleveland's major sports franchises for decades.
The Guardians, then known as the Cleveland Indians, played in the World Series in 1995, 1997, and 2016, but lost all three to the Atlanta Braves, Florida Marlins, and Chicago Cubs, respectively.  Cleveland has not won a World Series since 1948.

Title: Curse of the Bambino
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Bambino
Content: The Curse of the Bambino was a superstitious sports curse in Major League Baseball (MLB) derived from the 86-year championship drought of the Boston Red Sox between 1918 and 2004. The superstition was named after Babe Ruth, colloquially known as "The Bambino", who played for the Red Sox until his contract was sold to the New York Yankees in 1920. While some fans took the curse seriously, most used the expression in a tongue-in-cheek manner.
Prior to the drought, the Red Sox had been one of the most successful professional baseball franchises. They won five of the first fifteen World Series titles, including the first in 1903, more than any other MLB team at the time. During this period, Ruth was a contributor to the Red Sox's three championships in 1915, 1916, and 1918. Following the sale of Ruth, however, the once lackluster Yankees became one of the most dominant professional sports franchises in North America, winning more than twice as many World Series titles as any other MLB team. The curse became a focal point of the Yankees–Red Sox rivalry over the years.
Talk of the curse as an ongoing phenomenon ended when the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series. The Red Sox's championship was prefaced by them overcoming a 3–0 deficit against the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series (ALCS), the first and, as of 2025, only time an MLB team won a best-of-seven playoff series after losing the first three games.
The curse had been such a part of Boston culture that when a "reverse curve" road sign on Longfellow Bridge over the city's Storrow Drive was graffitied to read "Reverse The Curse", officials left it in place until the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series. After the World Series that year, the road sign was edited to read "Reversed Curse" in celebration before its removal. On the 20th anniversary of their World Series win, the sign was displayed on a duck boat during the Red Sox 2024 home opener parade.

Title: Curse of the Billy Goat
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Billy_Goat
Content: The Curse of the Billy Goat was a sports curse that was supposedly placed on the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise in 1945, by Billy Goat Tavern owner William Sianis. The curse lasted 71 years, from 1945 to 2016. During Game 4 of the 1945 World Series at Wrigley Field, Sianis's pet goat, named Murphy, was bothering other fans, and so the pair were asked to leave the stadium. Outraged, Sianis allegedly declared, "Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more", which had been interpreted to mean that the Cubs would never win another National League (NL) pennant, at least for the remainder of Sianis's life.
The Cubs lost the 1945 World Series to the Detroit Tigers, and did not win a pennant or World Series championship again until 2016. The Cubs had last won the World Series in 1908. After the incident with Sianis and Murphy, the Cubs did not play in the World Series for the next 71 years until, on the 46th anniversary of William Sianis's death, the "curse" was broken when they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 5–0 in Game 6 of the 2016 National League Championship Series to win the NL pennant. The Cubs then defeated the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians 8–7 in 10 innings in Game 7 to win the World Series, 108 years after their last win.

As with other supposed baseball curses, such as the crosstown Chicago Cubs' Curse of the Billy Goat (1945–2016), or the Boston Red Sox' Curse of the Bambino (1918–2004), these "curses" have been publicized by the popular media over the course of time.

Content: The Curse of Timur or the Curse of Tamerlane (Russian: Проклятие Тамерлана) is the rumor that the tomb of Timur is cursed such that whoever disturbs it will face a calamity. A popular version of the story of the curse holds that when Soviet anthropologists opened the tomb in June 1941, they found an inscription saying that whoever opened it would unleash an invader worse than him. The tomb was opened on June 20, 1941. On June 22, 1941, Hitler began the surprise invasion of the Soviet Union, leading many people to believe that it was caused by the curse. In addition, the Soviet victory in the Battle of Stalingrad has been credited to the curse being broken by Timur getting a reburial about one month before the victory in the battle.

Title: Death by coconut
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_by_coconut
Content: Coconuts falling from their trees and striking individuals can cause serious injury to the back, neck, shoulders and head, and are occasionally fatal.
Following a 1984 study on "Injuries Due to Falling Coconuts", exaggerated claims spread concerning the number of deaths by falling coconuts. Falling coconuts, according to urban legend, kill a few people a year. This legend gained momentum after the 2002 work of a noted expert on shark attacks was characterized as saying that falling coconuts kill 150 people each year worldwide. This statistic has often been contrasted with the number of shark-caused deaths per year, which is around five.
Concern about the risk of fatality due to falling coconuts led local officials in Queensland, Australia, to remove coconut trees from beaches in 2002. One newspaper dubbed coconuts "the killer fruit". Historical reports of actual death by coconut nonetheless date back to the 1770s.
Death by coconut can also occur as sudden cardiac death caused by hyperkalemia after consuming moderate to large quantities of coconut water, due to its high potassium level. Although rare, cases have also been reported of anaphylaxis among patients with a food allergy to coconut.

The case gained widespread attention due to the unusual condition of the body, including cross-dressing elements and complex bindings, leading to speculations of murder, ritual involvement, or supernatural causes. Official investigations concluded it was an accidental death from positional asphyxia during autoerotic activity, but controversies persist.

Title: The Devil's Chair (urban legend)
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Chair_(urban_legend)
Content: The term devil's chair (or haunted chair) in folklore is frequently attached to a class of funerary or memorial sculpture common in the United States during the nineteenth century and often associated with legend tripping. Nineteenth-century graveyards sometimes included carved chairs for the comfort of visitors. In this function, the object was known as a "mourning chair," and cemeteries have since provided benches for similar purposes, most often movable units of the type used in parks, but also specimens in the tradition of the carved chairs.
Some carved chairs were probably not intended for use as anything but monuments, while the "monubench" is still commercially available. Once the original purpose of these chairs fell out of fashion, superstitions developed in association with the act of sitting in them. In a typical example, local young people dare one another to visit the site, most often after dark, at midnight, or on some specified night such as Halloween or New Year's Eve. Variously, the stories suggest the person brave enough to sit in the chair at such a time may be punished for impudence or rewarded for courage.

The creation is likely due to papal catalogues accidentally confusing the title domnus for a proper name caused by the later addition of some antipopes into papal listings. His existence had been documented since at least the 15th century, and he was considered a pope by the Vatican for more than 200 years until the timeline was corrected in 1947. Despite his fictitious record, the nonexistent pope had been praised for honorable conduct.

Content: Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 was a scheduled flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, United States, to Miami International Airport in Miami, Florida, United States. Shortly before midnight on December 29, 1972, the Lockheed L-1011-1 TriStar crashed into the Florida Everglades. All three cockpit crew members, 2 of the 10 flight attendants, and 96 of the 163 passengers were killed. 75 people survived, with 58 of them suffering serious injuries.
The crash occurred while the entire flight crew were preoccupied with a burnt-out landing gear indicator light. The captain bumped the yoke on the aircraft, causing it to turn off the autopilot. Due to the focus on the landing gear and the minimal changes in the cockpit, the pilots did not notice. Because of this, the aircraft gradually lost altitude and crashed. This was the first hull loss and fatal crash of a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. It was also the first severe widebody aircraft crash.

Content: Egg balancing is a traditional Chinese practice of standing eggs on their ends that has also been popularized in the United States. Although the irregular shape of eggs makes this somewhat difficult, eggshells typically have many textural variations such that the vast majority can be balanced on their broad ends with minimal effort. 
Folklore holds that eggs can be balanced in this way only at a particular time of year: the lunar new year in China, the Dragon Boat Festival in Taiwan, or the vernal equinox in the United States. It is also said that eggs can be balanced on the heads of nails at the equator. In reality, eggs will balance anywhere at any time of year, and the practice has no connection to the gravitational force of the moon or sun.

Content: An elephants' graveyard (also called elephant graveyard, elephant's graveyard, or elephants' cemetery) is a place where, according to legend, old elephants instinctively direct themselves when they reach a certain age. According to this legend, these elephants would then die there alone, far from the group. However, there is no evidence in support of the existence of the elephants' graveyard.

Title: Ellis Island Special
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Island_Special
Content: An Ellis Island Special is a family name that is perceived or labeled, incorrectly, as having been anglicized or otherwise altered by immigration officials at the Ellis Island immigration station when a family reached the United States, typically from Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In popular lore, some family lore, and literary fiction, certain family names are thought to have been shortened by immigration officials for ease of pronunciation and/or record-keeping, or simply due to lack of understanding of the true name—even though the name changes were made by the immigrants themselves at other times. Immigration officials at Ellis Island did not write down the names of immigrants. Names were only written down on shipping manifests by officials in Europe or elsewhere. Before visas existed, there was no official identification of immigrants arriving at Ellis Island. Immigration officials at Ellis Island opened the shipping manifest to inspect the names of arriving immigrants and to ask them questions, but did not write any names down.
Among the surnames that are thought of as being "Ellis Island Specials" are many that were viewed as more identifiably Jewish, resulting in last names that were not identifiably so. Also, Germanic- and Yiddish-derived names originally spelled with an Eszett (spoken with an s sound but written  ß) have been ascribed to family names like Straub (given the similarity with the letter B), which might have been said originally as Strauss in the Old World.
The phrase "Ellis Island Special" has also been adopted by some food vendors and applied to sandwiches, among other foods.

Title: Elvis Presley death conspiracy theories
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley_death_conspiracy_theories
Content: Since Elvis Presley's death on August 16, 1977, various false and discredited conspiracy theories have circulated stating that he may still be alive. "Elvis sightings" from people incorrectly claiming to have seen him after this date are a phenomenon both as an ironic meme and also as part of a genuine belief for some.
In the early 1980s, the possibility of Presley still being alive was a niche topic discussed by a fringe demographic of fans in underground zines. It crossed over into widespread media attention in 1987 after a woman named Louise Welling falsely claimed to have seen Elvis at a Burger King in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The absurdity, "Middle America-ness" and the sound of the name "Kalamazoo" made for an ironic, light story in newspaper and television outlets. Theories and misinformation on the topic were then widely popularised by authors Gail Brewer-Giorgio and Major Bill Smith, who were given a platform by American and international media. Two TV specials that perpetuated these theories, The Elvis Files and The Elvis Conspiracy, aired internationally in 1991 and 1992.
Since then, popular interest in the topic has waned but "Elvis sightings" have stayed resonant as a part of pop culture. The conspiracy theory itself has become iconic as an example of the "genre" and a forerunner of the post-truth era, going on to influence many other theories including QAnon.

Title: Embarrassing cheque
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassing_cheque
Content: The embarrassing cheque is a confidence trick which may also be an urban legend.
The scam was supposedly performed by a company selling pornography or other sex aids and trading under a highly explicit name. Customers were invited to purchase adult material from the company, and were assured that the actual transaction could be made with a separate company with a non-explicit name in order to prevent the explicit name from appearing on transaction logs and bank statements.  
In fact, the company did not have any items to sell. Once a sufficient number of customers had sent money for items, the company sent out letters of apology to all of them, saying the items were no longer available. They also sent them refunds - in the form of company cheques clearly printed with the explicit company name.
The plan would be that the customers would be too embarrassed to cash in a cheque showing the company's real name ("The Anal Sex And Fetish Pornography Company"), not wanting other persons to know about their private lives, so the cheques would never be cashed, and thus the scammers running the company got to keep the money.  (The authors of snopes.com have pointed out that customers could cash the cheques via ATM or mail and thus avoid having to confront a bank worker in person. This would not have prevented, however, the cheque description potentially appearing on their customer file.)
It is not known if this trick ever actually happened or not. It is referred to in the film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (using "Arse Tickler's Faggots Fan Club" as an embarrassing company name) and the TV series Eureka Street but existed as a legend prior to that.

Title: Eskimo words for snow
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_words_for_snow
Content: The claim that Eskimo words for snow are unusually numerous, particularly in contrast to English, is a cliché commonly used to support the controversial linguistic relativity hypothesis. In linguistic terminology, the relevant languages are the Eskimo–Aleut languages, specifically the Yupik and Inuit varieties.
The strongest interpretation of the linguistic relativity hypothesis, also known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis or "Whorfianism", posits that a language's vocabulary (among other features) shapes or limits its speakers' view of the world. This interpretation is widely criticized by linguists, though a 2010 study supports the core notion that the Yupik and Inuit languages have many more root words for frozen variants of water than the English language. The original claim is loosely based in the work of anthropologist Franz Boas and was particularly promoted by his contemporary, Benjamin Lee Whorf, whose name is connected with the hypothesis. The idea is commonly tied to larger discussions on the connections between language and thought.

Title: Evil clown
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_clown
Content: The evil clown is a subversion of the traditional comic clown character, in which the playful trope is instead depicted in a more disturbing nature through the use of horror elements and dark humor. The modern archetype of the evil clown was popularized by the DC Comics supervillain Joker starting in 1940, and again in the 1980s by Pennywise from Stephen King's It. The character can be seen as playing on the sense of unease felt by sufferers of coulrophobia, the fear of clowns.

Title: False etymology
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_etymology
Content: A false etymology, also known as paretymology is an incorrect theory about the origin or derivation of a specific word or phrase. When a false etymology becomes a popular belief in a cultural or linguistic community, it is a folk etymology (or popular etymology). (Folk etymology may also refer to the process by which a word or phrase is changed because of a popular false etymology.)
Such etymologies often have the feel of urban legends and can be more colorful and fanciful than the typical etymologies found in dictionaries, often involving stories of unusual practices in particular subcultures (e.g. Oxford students from non-noble families being supposedly forced to write sine nobilitate by their name, soon abbreviated to s.nob., hence the word snob).

Title: Faxlore

Content: Faxlore is a sort of folklore: humorous texts, folk poetry, folk art, and  urban legends that are circulated, not by word of mouth, but by fax machine.  Xeroxlore or photocopylore is similar material circulated by photocopying.
The first use of the term xeroxlore was in Michael J. Preston's essay "Xerox-lore", 1974. "Photocopylore" is perhaps the most frequently encountered name for the phenomenon now, because of trademark concerns involving the Xerox Corporation.  The first use of this term came in A Dictionary of English Folklore by Jacqueline Simpson and Steve Roud.

Title: Five-second rule
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-second_rule
Content: The five-second rule, or sometimes the three-second rule, is a food hygiene urban legend that states a defined time window after which it is not safe to eat food (or sometimes to use cutlery) after it has been dropped on the floor or on the ground and thus exposed to contamination.
While the amount of microbes transferred to a dropped food does increase over time, and in some situations floors may be relatively clean of pathogens, the scientific consensus is opposed to such a general applied rule, and the origin of the idea is unclear. It is speculated to have originated from legends about Genghis Khan. It was first mentioned in print in 1995.

Content: Folk devils are groups portrayed in folklore or the media as outsiders and deviant, and who are blamed for crimes or other sorts of social problems.
The pursuit of folk devils frequently intensifies into a mass movement that is called a moral panic.  When a moral panic is in full swing, the folk devils are the subject of loosely organized but pervasive campaigns of hostility through gossip and the spreading of urban legends. The mass media sometimes get in on the act or attempt to create new folk devils in an effort to promote controversy. Sometimes the campaign against the folk devil influences a nation's politics and legislation.

Title: Friend of a friend

Content: In sociology, a friend of a friend is a human contact that exists because of a mutual friend. Person C is a friend of a friend of person A when there is a person B that is a friend of both A and C. Thus the human relation "friend of a friend" is a compound relation among friends, similar to the uncle and aunt relations of kinship. Though friendship is a reciprocal relation, the relation of a friend of a friend may not be a friendship, though it holds potential for coalition building and dissemination of information.

Title: Ghost of Kyiv

Content: The Ghost of Kyiv (Ukrainian: Привид Києва, romanized: Pryvyd Kyieva, pronounced [ˈprɪwɪd ˈkɪjewɐ]) is the nickname given to a mythical MiG-29 Fulcrum flying ace who was alleged to have shot down six Russian planes over Kyiv during the Kyiv offensive on 24 February 2022. The origin of the myth is unclear, but it was propagated widely by both Ukrainian and Western media outlets, as well as official sources such as the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Security Service of Ukraine. The Ghost of Kyiv has been credited as a morale booster for Ukrainians during the Russo-Ukrainian War.
Two months after the story spread, the Ukrainian Air Force acknowledged that it was not factual, and warned people not to "neglect the basic rules of information hygiene" and to "check the sources of information, before spreading it". Experts have stated that stories such as Ghost of Kyiv are part of Ukrainian propaganda or a morale-boosting campaign, or potentially both.

Title: Gloomy Sunday urban legends
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloomy_Sunday
Content: "Gloomy Sunday" (Hungarian: Szomorú Vasárnap), also known as the "Hungarian Suicide Song", is a song composed by Hungarian pianist and composer Rezső Seress and published in 1933.
The original lyrics were titled "Vége a világnak" ("The World Is Ending") and were about despair caused by war, ending in a quiet prayer about people's sins. Poet László Jávor wrote his own lyrics to the song, titled "Szomorú vasárnap" ("Sad Sunday"), in which the protagonist wants to commit suicide following his lover's death. The latter lyrics ended up becoming more popular while the former were essentially forgotten. The song was first recorded in Hungarian by pop singer Pál Kalmár in 1935.
"Gloomy Sunday" was first recorded in English by Hal Kemp in 1936, with lyrics by Sam M. Lewis, and was recorded the same year by Paul Robeson, with lyrics by Desmond Carter. It became well known throughout much of the English-speaking world after the release of a version by jazz and swing music singer Billie Holiday in 1941. Lewis's lyrics refer to suicide, and the record label described it as the "Hungarian Suicide Song". There is a recurring urban legend which claims that many people have taken their own lives while listening to this song, particularly Hungarians.

Title: Great horse manure crisis of 1894
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_horse_manure_crisis_of_1894
Content: The great horse manure crisis of 1894 is an urban myth that a significant obstacle to urban development at the turn of the 20th century was the difficulty of removing horse manure from the streets of major Western cities. The phrase originates from a 2004 article by Stephen Davies entitled "The Great Horse-Manure Crisis of 1894" which stated that "Writing in the Times of London in 1894, one writer estimated that in 50 years every street in London would be buried under nine feet of manure.". However, no such article has been located and the newspaper refuted the attribution in 2018.
More broadly, it is an analogy for supposedly insuperable extrapolated problems being rendered moot by the introduction of new technologies.

Title: Haridas Pal
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haridas_Pal
Content: Haridas Pal (Bengali: হরিদাস পাল) is a fictional Bengali character known for his greatness, stature and grandeur. He is a person who is highly respected in the society for his noble thoughts and deeds and therefore commands authority over the mass. Any such highly influential person is referred to as Haridas Pal.
The Bengali phrase Tumi Kon Haridas Pal? (Bengali: তুমি কোন হরিদাস পাল?) literally meaning "Which Haridas Pal are you?" is often used to question his credentials when someone tries to exert his authority over matters which are apparently beyond his sphere of influence. Through this question he is bluntly told that he doesn't belong to the stature of Haridas Pal and therefore his questioning and suggestions are unwelcome. Later an alternative phrase Ke Tumi Haridas Pal? (Bengali: কে তুমি হরিদাস পাল?) literally meaning "Who are you Haridas Pal?" also began to be used to address the second person as Haridas Pal himself and dismiss him as a non-entity. Usage of such phrase began to alternatively define Haridas Pal as someone who is suffering from illusory superiority or delusions of greatness and grandeur. Through years of misuse of the corrupted alternative the name Haridas Pal has alternatively become an expression of contempt and mockery.

Title: Herobrine
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herobrine
Content: Herobrine is an urban legend and creepypasta from the sandbox video game Minecraft. He is often depicted as a version of the Minecraft character Steve, but with solid white eyes that lack pupils, and behavior that primarily involves destroying the player's world. The story originated from an anonymous post on 4chan's /v/ board in 2010, where the author reported encountering a strange figure in a single-player world, followed by their messages being deleted when they attempted to talk to other players about the sighting. The story was further popularized after livestreamers Copeland and Patimuss created their own versions.
Herobrine has become a popular part of the online culture surrounding Minecraft, as well as effectively an internet meme. Interest in the character inspired many to create their own stories and alleged sightings centered around Herobrine, as well as create Minecraft mods that add him to the game. Interest in the character continued into the 2020s, leading to the rediscovery of formerly lost media related to the original sightings. Herobrine has been considered one of the most notable legends in video games, with his popularity leading to him ranking on a  Guinness World Records poll for the best video game villains despite never truly existing within Minecraft. The character has been referenced several times by the developers of Minecraft, appearing on official artwork as well.

Content: Huelga a la japonesa (Spanish for "Japanese-style strike") is an urban legend from Spain and Latin America. The story explains that it is a phenomenon that emerged in Japan as a measure of union pressure in which the workers devote more effort and dedication to their tasks than normal, causing an overproduction that the owners of the industry can not distribute on the market, causing serious economic disruption.
The legend is based on the stereotype around the work culture of Japanese workers, which together with the relative remoteness of the country and its just in time production style, make it appear a credible story.

Title: Inadvertent consumption of spiders
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_depictions_of_spiders
Content: Throughout history, spiders have been depicted in popular culture, mythology, and symbolism. From African folklore to Greek mythology, the spider has been used to represent a variety of things, and endures into the present day with characters such as Shelob from The Lord of the Rings and Spider-Man from the eponymous comic series. It is also a symbol of mischief and malice for its toxic venom and the slow death it causes, which is often seen as a curse. In addition, the spider has inspired creations from an ancient geoglyph to a modern steampunk spectacle. Spiders have been the focus of fears, stories and mythologies of various cultures for centuries.
The spider has symbolized patience and persistence due to its hunting technique of setting webs and waiting for its prey to become ensnared. Numerous cultures attribute the spider's ability to spin webs with the origin of spinning, textile weaving, basket weaving, knotwork, string games and net making. Spiders are associated with creation myths because they seem to weave their own artistic worlds. Philosophers often use the spider's web as a metaphor or analogy, and today, terms such as the Internet or World Wide Web evoke the inter-connectivity of a spider web.
Many goddesses associated with spiders and other female portrayals reflect observations of their specific female-dominated copulation.

Title: Jackie Chan Curse
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Chan
Content: Fang Shilong (born Chan Kong-sang; 7 April 1954), known professionally as Jackie Chan and Sing Lung, is a Hong Kong martial artist, actor and filmmaker, known for his slapstick, acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, and innovative stunts, which he typically performs himself. With a film career spanning more than sixty years, he is regarded as one of the most iconic and influential martial artists in the history of cinema.  Films in which he has appeared have grossed over $6 billion worldwide.
Starting as one of the Seven Little Fortunes at the China Drama Academy, where he was trained in acrobatics, martial arts and acting, Chan entered the Hong Kong film industry as a stuntman before making the transition to acting. His breakthrough came with the action comedy Snake in the Eagle's Shadow (1978). He then starred in similar action comedies such as Drunken Master (1978) and The Young Master (1980). He made his directorial debut with The Fearless Hyena (1979), which was a box office success. Throughout the 1980s, he was part of the "Three Dragons" along with Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao; the three starred in six Hong Kong films together. Project A (1983) saw the official formation of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team and established Chan's signature style of elaborate, dangerous stunts combined with martial arts and slapstick humor, a style he further developed in a more modern setting with Wheels on Meals (1984) and Police Story (1985). Rumble in the Bronx (1995), which had a successful worldwide theatrical run, brought Chan into the North American mainstream. By the mid-1990s, he was the most popular action movie star in Asia and Europe.
Chan gained Hollywood success for portraying Chief Inspector Lee in the American buddy cop action comedy film Rush Hour (1998), a role he reprised in two sequels. He went on to work both in American and Chinese films, appearing in the Shanghai film series (2000–2003), New Police Story (2004), Rob-B-Hood (2006), Little Big Soldier (2010), Shaolin (2011), and The Shadow's Edge (2025), among others. The Forbidden Kingdom (2008) marked his first collaboration with fellow martial arts star Jet Li. He has played martial arts mentor Mr. Han in two Karate Kid films, the 2010 remake The Karate Kid and Karate Kid: Legends (2025). For CZ12 (2012), he earned two Guinness World Records for "Most Stunts Performed by a Living Actor" and "Most Credits in One Movie". He played against type in Shinjuku Incident (2009) and The Foreigner (2017). His voice acting work includes all three Chinese versions of Mulan (1998), the first three films in the Kung Fu Panda franchise (2008–2016), and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023). 
One of the most recognizable and influential film personalities in the world, Chan was described by film scholar Andrew Willis in 2004 as perhaps "the most recognized star in the world." He has received fame stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame, as well as an honorary Academy Award in 2016. Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, films, television series, and video games. He has an award named after him, the Jackie Chan Action Movie Awards. He is an operatically trained vocalist who has released several pop music albums and performed theme songs for some of the films in which he starred. He is also a philanthropist and was named one of the top 10 most charitable celebrities by Forbes in 2011. In 2016, Forbes ranked him the second-highest-paid actor in the world. In 2025, Parade estimated his net worth to be $400 million, and reported he planned to leave his fortune to charity, rather than to his son, Jaycee Chan.

Title: Just-so story
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story
Content: In science and philosophy, a just-so story is an untestable narrative explanation for a cultural practice, a biological trait, or behavior of humans or other animals. The pejorative nature of the expression is an implicit criticism that reminds the listener of the fictional and unprovable nature of such an explanation. Such tales are common in folklore genres like mythology (where they are known as etiological myths – see etiology). A less pejorative term is a pourquoi story, which has been used to describe usually more mythological or otherwise traditional examples of this genre, aimed at children.
This phrase is a reference to Rudyard Kipling's 1902 Just So Stories, containing fictional and deliberately fanciful tales for children, in which the stories pretend to explain animal characteristics, such as the origin of the spots on the leopard. It has been used to criticize evolutionary explanations of traits that have been proposed to be adaptations, particularly in the evolution–creation debates and in debates regarding research methods in sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.
However, the first widely acknowledged use of the phrase in the modern and pejorative sense seems to have originated in 1978 with Stephen Jay Gould, a prominent paleontologist and popular science writer. Gould expressed deep skepticism as to whether evolutionary psychology could ever provide objective explanations for human behavior, even in principle; additionally, even if it were possible to do so, Gould did not think that it could be proven in a properly scientific way.
